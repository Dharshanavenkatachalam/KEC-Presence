# AIM OF THE PROJECT : 

       This project aims to maintain attendance records in a digital format. The system will allow class advisors, year in-charges, and students to log in securely. 
       Students will be able to view their leave status, while class advisors and year in-charges will have the ability to manage attendance and leave requests.

       Additionally, the system will enable the addition of new users by signing them up through their email and password. The goal is to ensure that all records are kept safe and secure.
